# Connect four with a minimax style AI playing against you

A game of connect 4 where you play against the best possible ai


## Introduction

I chose this game because i've always loved connect four and find AI and different algorithms like that very interesting, key features of this game include the base game in pygame and a complex artifical intelligence which has been trained to near impossible to beat.

## Game/Objective Description
The Objective of the game is to get four of your colored pieces in a row in any direction, gravity does apply dropping each peice on top of the one prior in that column.

## How to Play the game/use the application:
You play the game by clicking the column which you would like to place your peice then wait for the ai to go and then its your turn to place your peice again!

## Features
This game of connect four is different from other ones because of the complex ai used to make the game extremely difficult to play against, this game is almost more of an experiment to show how powerful and how far into the future it can see.
